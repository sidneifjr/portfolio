      I had my first encounter with technology through computer magazines that
      my parents used to buy at a newsstand near our home. I got an introduction
      to front-end development during my Computer Technician course in 2015,
      which was love at first sight and led me to pursue a degree in <strong
        >Information Systems</strong
      >.

      As a proponent of continuous improvement, it's essential to stay updated
      with the latest trends and innovations in the field. In addition to
      keeping up with the development of various libraries, I also follow
      several content creators in the front-end space, including Fireship, Jack
      Herrington, Theo - t3.gg, developedbyed, and ByteGrad.

      As a <strong>Front-End Engineer</strong>, I work with a focus on React,
      Next.js, and TypeScript. However, this doesn't prevent me from exploring
      new technologies as needed (or out of curiosity). In the future, I also
      plan to work with backend and AI, given my previous experience with
      Node.js and Python.

      Some of my interests include swimming, weightlifting, classic cinema, and
      gaming.
